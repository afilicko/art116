                <h4><i>Michael 'Michael Chong'<br/>Rank: Baboon</i></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    My name is Michael irl (minus the Chong üòÇ) and I‚Äôm a 37 year-old guy from the UK living in Lincoln. In-game I mostly enjoy PvP and ratting. Been in a few corps since release but I‚Äôve spent most of my time in ST (stellar tyrants) followed by XAN (Xanadu industries), WHO (FSociety) and PEW (black legion) having joined HTP recently after returning from a long break. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Outside of the game I work full-time managing a residential care home specialising in caring for adults with disabilities (specifically cerebral palsy) which I‚Äôve been doing now for a few years. I live with my partner of 7 years (due to be my wife in March üòÅ) and hobbies/interests is pretty much just gaming, smoking concerning amounts of weed and marine aquatics. <br/><br/>
                    
                    Most prized possession is my mixed reef tank containing 90 or so different types of coral, a dozen fish and a bunch of invertebrates. It‚Äôs my obsession and hopefully in the next couple of years planning to make coral aquaculture into a career by starting my own business.

                <h4><i>Brandon 'Kermit'<br/>Rank: Baboon</i></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    My name is Brandon but I go by kermit. <br/>
                    I currently use Eve Echoes as a way to disassociate and escape from my life. <br/><br/>

                    "What life?" You might be asking yourself.<br/><br/>

                    Well, citizen, that's an excellent question and I thank you for it.<br/><br/>

                    I think it's great we live in a world where you can ask questions, <br/>
                    because without questions, we'd just have answers.<br/><br/>

                    And an answer without a question is a statement.<br/><br/>

                    Thank you.

                <h4><i>Ignis Nox<br/>Rank: Baboon</i></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    That one person who disappears for weeks on end, only to get a month's worth of work in a week.<br/>
                    Is a hobo with no permanent home and yet holds down 2 jobs and a toddler.<br/>                  
                    Somehow finds the the time to shitpost and rustle some jimmies on discord at odd hours of the night.<br/>
                    All about that indy mining lyfe

                <h4><i>Kyle Uledi<br/>Rank: Baboon/Ship Builder</i></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    Also known as The Prophet, is the leader of the Uledi Family.  Among other notable families  as the Uri, Nygreal, and Hap. <br/><br/>

                    Despite his long history as a miner, Kyle has never lost a ship to sleep and continues to mine, although not as frequently as before.<br/><br/>
                    
                    Kyle has been an avid player of Eve Echoes for the past three years, enjoying the entertainment and challenge the game provides. <br/><br/>
                    
                    He has played many other space-themed games, but none have compared to the depth and complexity of Eve Echoes.

                <h4><i>Gregary97 Hearst<br/>Rank: Director</i></h4>
                <blockquote>
                    Feet pic connoisseur and (questionable) Dread Pirate, Greg is proud to have played a role in the history of HTP's legendary Weaponized Stupidity (tm).<br/>
                    More of a barely tolerated mascot than an actual leader, Greg has caused alliances to fall by merely participating in their leadership.<br/><br/>

                    Lately, a mid-life crisis has limited his time in-game but he is delighted with the direction HTP has taken and touched himself a lot when our old/new alliance, TBD, was resurrected from the ashes of Hale.
